# Amino Development Phases

This document tracks the development phases for the Amino rule engine project.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Establish working foundation matching README examples

- [x] **Reorganize file structure per spec** - `schema/`, `rules/`, `runtime/`, `types/` modules
- [x] **Extend schema parser** - Support float, decimal, constraints
- [x] **Fix rule parser** - Handle complete expressions and operator precedence
- [x] **Build basic runtime engine** - Simple evaluation working
- [x] **Implement main API classes** - Schema, CompiledRules

## Phase 2: Type System âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Enable the key differentiator (extensible types)

- [x] **Create TypeRegistry** - Extensible type system
- [x] **Add struct support** - Schema parser handles struct definitions
- [x] **Implement list types** - Homogeneous/heterogeneous arrays (`list[int|str|float]`)
- [x] **Add type validation system** - Constraint checking functional

## Phase 3: Runtime Features âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Complete core functionality

- [x] **Build rule compiler** - AST to executable form
- [x] **Implement batch evaluation** - For datasets
- [x] **Foreign function interface (FFI)** - User functions integration
  - *Verified: `add_function()` works with runtime evaluation*
- [x] **Function declarations with default parameters** - Schema-level function definitions
  - *Verified: Parsing and runtime integration working correctly*

## Phase 4: Advanced Features âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Add production-ready features

- [x] **Performance optimizations** - Rule ordering, short-circuiting
  - *Implemented: Rule complexity estimation and ordering optimization*
  - *Implemented: Short-circuit evaluation for FIRST mode with explicit ordering*
- [x] **Comprehensive error handling system** - Better validation and error messages
  - *Implemented: Strict mode for schema parsing with custom type validation*
  - *Implemented: Enhanced error messages with context*
- [x] **First/ordering matching modes** - Advanced rule selection strategies
  - *Implemented: FIRST mode with ascending/descending ordering*
  - *Implemented: ALL mode (default) for comprehensive matching*
- [x] **Debugging and profiling tools** - Development and optimization support
  - *Implemented: RuleProfiler for performance analysis*
  - *Implemented: RuleDebugger for rule development assistance*
