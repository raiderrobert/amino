# amino

A toolkit and DSL for classification rules enginesâ€”sometimes called expert systems. Much focus has been given toward AI and machine learning tooling to help take humans out of the loop. However, there are exist a wide variety of current and future applications for custom rules engines.

Amino inverts the problem space by placing a schema at the center, not unlike how GraphQL has done so for APIs.

## Features

Amino has three key components:
- **Schema definition**: Like GraphQL or Protobuf for the data space it operates on
- **DSL**: A pre-built, small and extensible domain-specific language for conditional logic
- **Runtime**: Fast evaluation of rules against data sets

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install amino
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amino.git
cd amino
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+

### Your First Schema

Create a schema file `schema.amn`:
```
amount: Int
state_code: Str
```

Then use it in Python:
```python
import amino

# Load schema
amn = amino.load_schema("schema.amn")

# Evaluate a simple rule
result = amn.eval("amount > 0 and state_code = 'CA'", {
    "amount": 100, 
    "state_code": "CA"
})
print(result)  # True
```


## How to Use


### Basic Example

Declare a schema

schema.amn
```
amount: Int
state_code: Str
```

Import schema and evaluate a rule to see if it matches the matching variables passed in.

```
>>> import amino
>>> amn = amino.load_schema("schema.amn")
>>> amn.eval("amount > 0 and state_code = 'CA'", {"amount": 100, "state_code": "CA"})
True
>>> amn.eval("amount > 0 and state_code = 'CA'", {"amount": 0, "state_code": "CA"})
False
```


### More likely Runtime Example

Declare a schema

schema.amn
```
amount: Int
state_code: Str
```

Import schema and use it in your code. ( Note: You don't need to specify `id` for just one data set or one rule, but
you do need an `id` for more than one of either, and each `id` must unique. )

```
>>> import amino
>>> amn = amino.load_schema("schema.amn")
>>> compiled = amn.compile(
...    [
...        {"id": 1, "rule":"amount > 0 and state_code = 'CA'"},
...        {"id": 2, "rule":"amount > 10 and state_code = 'CA'"},
...        {"id": 3, "rule":"amount >= 100"},
...    ]
... )
>>> compiled.eval([
...    {"id": 45, "amount": 100, "state_code": "CA"},
...    {"id": 46, "amount": 50, "state_code": "CA"},
...    {"id": 47, "amount": 100, "state_code": "NY"},
...    {"id": 48, "amount": 10, "state_code": "NY"},
... ])

[
    {"id": 45, "results": [1, 2, 3]}, 
    {"id": 46, "results": [1, 2]},
    {"id": 47, "results": [3]},
    {"id": 48, "results": []},
]
```

We also support returning just one match.

```
>>> import amino
>>> amn = amino.load_schema("schema.amn")
>>> compiled = amn.compile(
...    [
...        {"id": 1, "rule":"amount > 0 and state_code = 'CA'", "ordering": 3},
...        {"id": 2, "rule":"amount > 10 and state_code = 'CA'", "ordering": 2},
...        {"id": 3, "rule":"amount >= 100", "ordering": 1},
...    ],
...    match={"option": "first", "key": "ordering", "ordering": "asc"}
... )
>>> compiled.eval([
...    {"id": 100, "amount": 100, "state_code": "CA"},
...    {"id": 101, "amount": 50, "state_code": "CA"},
...    {"id": 102, "amount": 50, "state_code": "NY"},
... ])

[
    {"id": 100, "results": [3]}, 
    {"id": 101, "results": [2]},
    {"id": 102, "results": []}
]
```


## Schema Elaboration


### Comments
We support comments with the `#` symbol. Anything to the right of the comment symbol is disregarded at runtime.

schema.amn
```
# this is a comment
amount: Int  # this is too
state_code: Str
```


### Structs
We support C-like structs with the `struct` keyword

schema.amn
```
struct applicant {
    state_code: Str,
}

struct loan {
    amount: Int
}

```


```
>>> data = {"loan": {"amount": 100}, "applicant": "state_code": "CA"
>>> rule = "loan.amount > 0 and applicant.state_code = 'CA'"
>>> amn.eval(rule, data)
True
```


### Functions
We support function declarations; you declare the inputs and output, and you 
implement the function in your own language. These aren't true functions. It may be more appropriate to call it a 
foreign function interface declaration. That is, amino is the host language, and your implementation language in your
project (e.g. Python, TypeScript, etc.) is the guest language.



schema.amn
```
amount: Int
state_code: Str

smallest_number: (first: Int, second: Int) -> Int

```

Note the passing of `min` and passing it into the `funcs` argument while loading the schema. This provides the DSL host language access to calling out to the guest function `min` while the host function in the DSL uses `smallest_number`.

```
>>> amn = amino.load_schema("schema.amn", funcs={'smallest_number': min})
>>> data = {"amount": 100, "state_code": "CA"}
>>> rule = "smallest_number(amount, 1000) < 1000 and state_code = 'CA'"
>>> amn.eval(rule, data)
True
```

#### Function Parameters

Functions require named parameters that clearly document their purpose:

schema.amn
```
amount: Int
state_code: Str

calculate_tax: (amount: Int, rate: Float) -> Float

```

Note the passing of `calculate_tax` and passing it into the `funcs` argument while loading the schema.

```
>>> def tax_calculator(amount, rate):
...     return amount * rate
>>> amn = amino.load_schema("schema.amn", {'calculate_tax': tax_calculator})
>>> data = {"amount": 100, "state_code": "CA"}
>>> rule = "calculate_tax(amount, 0.08) > 5.0 and state_code = 'CA'"
>>> amn.eval(rule, data)
True
```



### Lists

We support homogenous or heterogeneous arrays with the `list` keyword

schema.amn
```
state_code: Str
amounts: List[Int]
things: List[Int|Str|Float]
```



```
>>> data = {"amount": 100, "state_code": "CA", "things": ["CA", 1, 1.0] }
>>> rule = "amount > 0 and state_code = 'CA' or state_code in things"
>>> amn.eval(rule, data)
True
```
